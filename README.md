# Portfolio

This contains my code for my portfolio website that acts as an executive summary for my personal and professional accomplishments. I used a minimalist template and forked the repository over as a base. This website consists of HTML and CSS and contains the following sections.

- Profile Summary: Picture, Resume, LinkedIn, GitHub

- About: Brief bio

- Experience (Academic and Professional)

- Contact Information
