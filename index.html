            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>Hi! I am a recent graduate of Northeastern University's College of Engineering (2022), where I got my BS in Industrial Engineering and my MS in Industrial Engineering. My interest is in data analytics and business intelligence so I am looking
                for those types of analyst/developer positions post-grad. My initial interest was mainly in the traditional engineering topics (manufacturing, supply chain, quality, etc), but over time I developed a keen interest in data and its applications
                in addition to those original applications.</p>
            <p>Outside of academics, I played on the Northeastern Men's Club Soccer Team (one of the most competitive club soccer programs in the Northeast regions), I ski whenever I can in the winter season (I've skied in Colorado, California, Maine, Pennsylvania,
                New Hampshire, and Vermont), and I am an avid traveler (I've been to 13 different countries). The picture of me was taken in Porto, Portugal in June 2022!</p>
            <h2>Work/Academic Experience</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>HarbourVest Partners (Boston, MA), Junior Business Analyst (NU co-op), Jul. 2021 - Jan. 2022</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I worked in HarbourVest's (HVP) Information Technology (IT) group, more specifically for their User Enablement Team. During my time at HVP, I took ownership of a key IT dashboard in Power BI that had many visuals and metrics for HVP's different
                IT systems. I restructured the importation of multiple data sources, the data transformations in DAX (Power BI's querying language), and the subsequent data visuals to incorporate time and location/department drilldowns into most if not
                of the metrics. I also added 3 new completely automatic pages that visualized data for HVP's Microsoft systems. At HVP I learned how to communicate cross-functionally with multiple business stakeholders, I learned the importance, functionality,
                and the applications of IT data, and I learned how to use Power BI with DAX.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Generate Product Development, Northeastern University: Data & Strategy Lead (Data & Strategy Team), Jun. 2021 - Jan. 2022</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Generate is Northeastern's student-led product development studio that seeks to empower innovative ventures. We work with real startups and real products every semesters to support their product development needs (hardware or software). I
                originally joined as a data analyst on Generate's Operations Team during the Spring 2021 Semester, and I created a automated/dynamic dashboard in Python (Plotly/Dash) that showed results for an organization-wide internal survey. After
                1 semester, the Management Team created a Data and Strategy Team which I was put in charge of, and I got my first taste of being in a leadership role in a structured organization. I designed a vision and plan to hire 2-3 data analysts
                to expand our data analytics capabilities across the entire Generate organization at an appropriate pace within the organization's constraints. With that plan, we created processes to analyze Generate's Build Studio (our "engineers" that
                work with the ventures/clients are part of Generate's Build Studio team) hiring processes and to analyze Generate's finances and spending. These processes placed our new capabilities in good hands for future semesters to come, and I'm
                proud of the work our brand new team accomplished given that we started from ground zero. All of the team's source code is in Generate's GitHub, which is private, but I would be happy to talk about the work we did over email/phone/Zoom.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>IDEA Northeastern University's Venture Accelerator: Data Analyst (Tech Team), Aug. 2021 - May. 2022</li>
            </ul>
            <p>IDEA is Northeastern's student-led venture accelerator that provides resources and support to Northeastern entrepreneurs. We have three stages for potential ventures to work through (Ready, Set, Go). The venture/entrepreneur must pass each
                stage before going to the next stage. For the Go stage (the final stage), ventures can receive potential IDEA Gap Funding (non-equity grant funding) to help get their startup get off the ground. I joined as a data analyst on IDEA's Tech
                Team, and most of my initial work was done in Tableau searching for venture insights and generating data visualizations for those insights using data exported from our Salesforce CRM. However, as the team finished up its initial work,
                we decided that we would conduct our analysis with data loaded in real time from our Salesforce CRM. My next assignment was to look at overall venture matriculation (the number of ventures coming through IDEA's stages) over time, so this
                time I created an ELT to load our Salesforce data (a Salesforce calculated Report) into Python for analysis. From there, I used Plotly/Dash to create a dynamic dashboard that showed IDEA's venture count over customized time intervals along
                with the average number of days that ventures would spend in each IDEA stage for that respective time interval. All of the team's code is in IDEA's GitHub, which is private, but I would be happy to talk about the work we did over email/phone/Zoom.</p>
